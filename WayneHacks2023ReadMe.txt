Summary:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Project Eris is a modification for the Playstation Classic, a minitature version of the 
Playstation 1 released by Sony. The Playstation Classic looks identical to the original Playstation 1
except it is much smaller and has some bestselling games built in. The device thereby immerses the user in nostalgia
 
Project Eris allows the Playstation Classic to be improved,by allowing new emulators to operate,
 and new ROMs to be uploaded: in short adding more games.

Project Eris has a bootup screen that its default features to not allow to be eliminated. This bootup
screen loudly displays that its name is PROJECT ERIS and not the Playstation Classic. It is very apparently
not a part of the features of the original Playstation 1. This interferes with the users nostalgia and thus ruins
the experience. 

This mod replaces nearly all text on this bootup screen with the inky blackness of space.
